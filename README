              Template Toolkit Version 2.00 Beta Release 3

                              10-August-2000


              ** IMPORTANT WARNING FOR VERSION 1.xx USERS ** 

    If you install these modules you will totally screw up your
    existing version 1.* installation (if you have one, that is).  If
    you're ready to take the plunge and aren't relying too heavily on
    any of the "features" that have changed from version 1.xx to 2.xx
    (see Changes file), then go ahead.  Be bold.  See the Changes file
    for a summary of all the great new things for you to play with,
    and the issues that you might need to attend to.

    You might then decide to re-install Version 1.07 to a different
    location in case you ever need it, e.g.

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/where/else

    Remember to add "use lib '/some/where/else'" to your Perl scripts
    that want to use Version 1.07, and also to the V1 'tpage' and
    'ttree' scripts (in /some/where/else/bin) so that they continue to
    use the right versions of the modules.

    Alternatively, you can install this Version 2.00 beta to a
    different location and follow the strategy outlined above, or not
    "make install" it at all.

                     ** END OF IMPORTANT WARNING ** 

Hello World
-----------

This is the third (and possibly final) beta release of Version 2.00 of
the Perl Template Toolkit.  It is fully-featured, reliable and all
known bugs have been fixed (but see the TODO list for a few
outstanding issues and minor "features").  The Changes file details
changes from the last beta release, and versions before that.  It also
includes the major changes from Version 1.xx to 2.00.

The API is now frozen for Version 2.00.  The final remaining effort
was to improve the filters interface and this is now up to scratch with
the rest of the toolkit and suitable for release.

Most, if not all of the individual modules are fully documented and 
reasonably accurate and complete.  I need to do one final sweep to 
tidy up some loose ends, but on the whole they're pretty much there.

The main Template.pod document is complete or very nearly complete in 
all the important areas.  Configuration options are fully documented
and all but a few of the directives are documented, although with a 
handful of TODO's littered around marking sections that are incomplete
or in need of work.  We're still missing a general overview and possibly 
a few other meta-sections.  The documentation should probably be broken
up into smaller sections and converted to HTML for those that want it
that way.  That may happen before, or possibly after the release of 
Version 2.00

Enjoy!
