This list isn't complete - it's more of a reminder to me at the moment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* All directives now compile to Perl code and run

* USERDIR and USERBLOCK are currently not supported (and may never be,
  given that they're experimental features of TT1 anyway). 

* Fixed parser to not INTERPOLATE within PERL blocks.

* Added TAG_STYLEs html, mason, asp and php, as provided by some kind 
  dude on the list whose names escapes me at the moment.  Changed default 
  to [% %] and changed names of some others

* Changed how error/return values should be returned from user code.
  All errors should be thrown via one of the following:

    die $error_msg;
    die Template::Exception->new($type, $info);

* All binary operators have the same precedence as Perl.

* Added '-- use name --' to Template::Test to switch between multiple
  Template objects specified as a list reference as the second arg
  to test_expect()

* must explicitly use iterator if you want to access .first .last, etc.
  in a loop.

* note that parser is not loaded at startup time.





changes from alpha to beta
--------------------------

* fixed bug in Context filter() provider method which wasn't caching 
  filters with args.
