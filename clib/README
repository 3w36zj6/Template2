This directory contains an C/XS implementation of the Template::Stash
module.  It's still experimental.

--------------------------

Haven't looked at this for a couple of months and I know that in that
time, I've made a couple of minor changes to the Stash which might 
require folding in here.  The code is almost complete, but I know of
at least a couple of things missing:

  * Other than some of the very simple methods, e.g. scalar.defined,
    scalar.length, the virtual methods aren't implemented.  Some 
    (like list.push(), list.pop()) have been added to Stash.pm since
    I wrote Stash.xs and should be trivial to add to the XS code.
    In other cases, the XS code should go looking for the package
    hashes SCALAR_OPS, LIST_OPS, etc., in Template::Stash.pm and 
    call the entries if found.

  * No loader module.  I had a version of this but I think I lost it 
    along the way.  Very simply, you have a Stash.pm which does something
    like this (off the top of my head):

       $SCALAR_OPS = { ... };
       $OTHER_SHARED_DATA = { ... };

       eval { require Template::Stash::XS.pm };
       require Template::Stash::Perl.pm if $@;

    The XS.pm just has the regular "bootstrap" line to load the XS code.
    The Perl.pm is pretty much as it is.

  * That damn Makefile.PL!  The hardest, and as yet unsolved, problem I 
    had was trying to get the Makefile.PL to co-operate with the 
    Makefile.PL in the parent directory.  The installation should 
    let you skip building the XS stash, but I don't recall ever 
    getting it to work as intended.  Also, I don't recall being able
    to get it to install 'Stash.xs' as Template::Stash::XS.pm'.  Sheesh!
