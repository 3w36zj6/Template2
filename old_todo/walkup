  * For historical reasons, our HTML developers require that
    files that are INCLUDEd or PROCESSed be searched for in a
    tree-walking manner, starting with the directory of
    $r->filename and ascending to /. This has the effect of
    including the closest copy of files declared in TT2PreProcess
    and TT2PostProcess, which works out very well for using a
    single set of header and footer files for an entire site,
    while having section specific navigation bars and features
    that get included without having to specify paths and the
    like.

abw: I like the idea of implementing this in the provider
someone.  Maybe specify a flag on an INCLUDE_PATH like:
INCLUDE_PATH => '/usr/web/tt2/lib/+' or '/usr/web/tt2/lib/-'
where the '+' is 'walkdown' (from root to leaf) and '-' is
'walkup' (from leaf to root) based on the current template
location.
