Template::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about the Template Toolkit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Frequently Asked Questions list for the Template Toolkit.
More accurately, it's a very thin placeholder for where the FAQ will
soon be.

=head2 General Questions

=over 4

=item Why is the sky blue?

Something to do with refraction.

=back

=head2 Language

=over 4

=item Why doesn't [% a = b IF c %] work as expected?

Because the parser interprets it as [% a = (b IF c) %].

Do this instead:

    [% SET a = b IF c %]

=back

=head2 Plugins

=over 4

=item Using the Table plugin, how do I order the data to go across rather than down?

Order the data into rows:

     Steve     Karen     Jeff
     Brooklyn  Nantucket Fairfax
     NY        MA        VA
 
    [% USE table(data, rows=3) %]
 
Then ask for each column
 
    [% FOREACH column = table.cols %]
 
And then print each item in the column going across the output rows
 
    [% FOREACH item = column %]
	<td>[% item %]</td>
    [% END %]

=head2 Extending the Template Toolkit

=over 4

=item Can I serve templates from a database?

Short answer: yes, Chris Nandor has done this for Slash.  You need to 
subclass Template::Provider.  See the mailing list archives for further
info.

=item Can I fetch templates via http?

    > i was wondering if there is anyway to fetch a file using http:// or

    Here's one way.  Set the LOAD_PERL option:
      
    	use Template;
     
    	my $template = Template->new({  
    	    LOAD_PERL => 1
    	});  
    	$template->process("example.tt", { stdout => *STDOUT })
    				     || die $template->error();
     
    and then use LWP::UserAgent and HTTP::Request:
     
    	[% 
    	    USE ua = LWP.UserAgent; 
    	    ua.proxy("http", "http://your_proxy/");
    	    USE req = HTTP.Request("GET", "http://www.cpan.org");
    	    ua.request(req).content;
    	-%]
     
    For FTP use Net::FTP:
     
    	[%   
    	    USE ftp = Net.FTP("ftp.cpan.org");
    	    x = ftp.login("anonymous", "me@here.there");
    	    x = ftp.cwd("/");
    	    x = ftp.get("welcome.msg", stdout);
    	    x = ftp.quit;
    	-%]
     
    Normally ftp.get would write the file into the current directory.
    Instead we pass stdout as a second argument so that it is written
    to stdout.  We set stdout to STDOUT in the variables we pass to
    process.
