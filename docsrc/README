This is the docsrc bundle for the Template Toolkit.  This contains all
the templates, XML, scripts and other bits and pieces required to build
the Template Toolkit documentation in both POD and HTML form.

Contents:

    bin     scripts for building the TT documentation
    lib     library containing shared document "chunks"
    pod     output for generated .pod files
    src     source directory for documentation templates
    txt     output for generated text files (e.g. Changes)
    xml     source directory for XML files

This 'docsrc' directory should be installed within the Template 
Toolkit distribution directory, i.e. at the same level and alongside
the 'docs' and 'lib' directories.

The source templates for the documentation are in the 'src' directory.
Additional template elements can be found in the 'lib' library directory.
The 'xml' directory contains the 'ttdocs.xml' file which contains
metadata for the documentation set.  

The 'bin' directory contains the 'ttmkdocs' script which builds the 
documentation.  The generated documentation gets written to the 
'pod' directory in POD form.  The HTML documentation gets written
to the '../docs/src' directory (yes, that's the 'docs' directory 
in the distribution root) along with the '../docs/lib/docset/config'
file which includes data structures describing the documentation 
pages.  The release notes (README, Changes and TODO) get written 
into the 'txt' directory.

The 'ttpodglu' script can then be used to install the POD documentation
and release notes into place.  The POD files in 'pod' gets glued onto
the end of the corresponding .pm files in '../lib/' (yep, the main TT2
lib directory), or copied as a '.pod' file if there isn't a corresponding
.pm file (e.g. Template::Manual, Template::FAQ, etc).  The documentation
for the tools, Template::Tools::(tpage|ttree), also get grafted onto
the end of the relevant scripts in ../bin.  The release notes get
copied to '..', the main TT2 distribution directory.
