This directory contains the source templates, components and configuration 
files for building the HTML documentation.   The documentation can be
built using 'ttree'.  The 'config' directory contains a template for 
generating an appropriate ttree configuration file which can then be used
to building the documentation itself.  The installation process performs
this step, generating 'plain.cfg' and 'splash.cfg' in that directory.
Otherwise, see the 'config/README' directory for further instructions 
on generating a config file.  You can then run ttree specifying the 
relevant config file to build the docs in the style of your choice.  e.g

    $ ttree -f ./config/plain.cfg

and/or:

    $ ttree -f ./config/splash.cfg

These process the pages in the 'src' directory, using additional
library elements in the 'lib' directory and style specific elements in
'style/plain' or 'style/splash', depending on which style you choose.
The HTML pages are written to the 'html' directory, in a subdirectory
of the same name as the style, e.g. 'html/plain' or 'html/splash'.
Thus, you can build both styles and they will co-exist.  All the pages
use relative links to reference each other, so you can safely copy the
contents of either directory anywhere you like, symlink to it, or do
whatever else you need to do to make the pages visible to your web
server.
