This directory contains the source templates, components and
configuration file for building the HTML documentation.

The 'config' directory contains a default ttree configuration file,
'default.cfg', which is automatically generated at installation time
(when the Makefile.PL is run).  It contains values based on those
specified for the TT2 installation directory and desired style, one of
'plain' or 'splash'.

If the user requests it, then the HTML documentation is built at run
time when the "make install" happens.  This is achieved by calling
ttree and specifying the config file via the -f option.  Something
like this:

    $ ttree -f /usr/local/tt2/docs/config/default.cfg

All the source templates are in the 'src' directory.  These are generated
automatically from the POD documentation which itself is built from a
separate set of TT2 templates, XML, Perl scripts and other magical bits
and pieces.  The 'docsrc' bundle is distributed separately from the 
main Template Toolkit distribution.  It's available from the TT2 web site,
at http://www.template-toolkit.org/docs/ if you're interested in seeing
how that fits together, or if you want to do some work on the docs.

The 'lib' directory contains some general purpose template elements
and also an automatically generated configuration file 'docset/config'
which describes the structure and metadata for all the pages.  The 
templates use this to correctly set menu links, cross-references, etc.,
between pages.

The 'style' directory contains style-specific elements in 'plain' or
'splash' formats.  You can copy these and create your own styles if
you like. 

    $ cp -R style/plain style/my_style_a

Then you can copy the default ttree config file to one of your own
and edit accordingly

    $ cp config/default.cfg config/my_style_a.cfg

To build the HTML in your own style you simply call ttree and specify
your own configuration file.

    $ ttree -f /usr/local/tt2/docs/config/my_style_a.cfg

The 'html' directory is the default location for the generated HTML
files, but you could, of course, change your ttree configuration file
to send it wherever you like.

Don't forget that you can specify as many 'lib' options in the
configuration file as you like.  e.g.

    lib  = /usr/local/tt2/docs/style/my_style_b
    lib  = /usr/local/tt2/docs/style/splash

So rather than copy an existing style, you might prefer to create a
new, empty style directory (e.g. my_style_b) in which you create new
elements which are then used in preference to those in the other style(s)
(e.g. splash).

All the pages use relative links to reference each other, so you can
safely copy the generated HTML pages anywhere you like, symlink to it,
or do whatever else you need to do to make the pages visible to your
web server.
