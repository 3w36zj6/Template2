This directory contains the source kit for the Template Toolkit
documentation.  Template files from 'src' are processed with library
elements in 'lib' with additional data supplied from xml/ttdocs.xml,
all under the control of bin/ttmkdocs.  The destination files come in
the form of a set of .pod files in 'pod', release notes in 'txt' and a
set of HTML templates in '../docs/src' and '../docs/lib'.  The
bin/ttpodglu script can then be run to copy the documentation into 
the right place or glue it onto the end of the relevant module file
(../lib) or script (../bin).

    bin	    scripts for building the TT documentation
    lib	    library containing shared document "chunks"
    pod     output for generated .pod files
    src	    source directory for documentation templates
    txt     output for generated text files (e.g. Changes) 
    xml     source directory for XML files
