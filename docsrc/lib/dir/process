[% TAGS star %]
=item PROCESS

The PROCESS directive is similar to INCLUDE but does not perform any 
localisation of variables before processing the template.  Any changes
made to variables within the included template will be visible in the
including template.

    [% foo = 10 %]

    foo is [% foo %]
    [% PROCESS bar %]
    foo is [% foo %]

    [% BLOCK bar %]
       [% foo = 20 %]
       changed foo to [% foo %]
    [% END %]

output:

    foo is 10
       changed foo to 20
    foo is 20

Parameters may be specified in the PROCESS directive, but these too will 
become visible changes to current variable values.

    [% foo = 10 %]
    foo is [% foo %]
    [% PROCESS bar
       foo = 20 
    %]
    foo is [% foo %]

    [% BLOCK bar %]
       this is bar, foo is [% foo %]
    [% END %]

output:

    foo is 10
       this is bar, foo is 20
    foo is 20

The PROCESS directive is slightly faster than INCLUDE because it
avoids the need to localise (i.e. copy) the variable stash before
processing the template.  As with INSERT and INCLUDE, the first
parameter does not need to be quoted as long as it contains only
alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods or forward slashes.
A '$' prefix can be used to explicitly indicate a variable which 
should be interpolated to provide the template name:

    [% myheader = 'my/misc/header' %]
    [% PROCESS  myheader %]              # 'myheader'
    [% PROCESS $myheader %]		 # 'my/misc/header'

As with INCLUDE, multiple templates can be specified, delimited by
'+', and are processed in order.

    [% PROCESS html/header + my/header %]
