[% TAGS star %]
=item INSERT

The INSERT directive is used to insert the contents of an external file
at the current position.

    [% INSERT myfile %]

No attempt to parse or process the file is made.  The contents,
possibly including any embedded template directives, are inserted
intact.

The filename specified should be relative to one of the INCLUDE_PATH
directories.  Absolute (i.e. starting with C</>) and relative
(i.e. starting with C<.>) filenames may be used if the ABSOLUTE and
RELATIVE options are set, respectively.  Both these options are
disabled by default.

    my $template = Template->new({
	INCLUDE_PATH => '/here:/there',
    });

    $template->process('myfile');

'myfile':

    [% INSERT foo %]		# looks for /here/foo then /there/foo
    [% INSERT /etc/passwd %]	# file error: ABSOLUTE not set
    [% INSERT ../secret %]	# file error: RELATIVE not set

For convenience, the filename does not need to be quoted as long as it
contains only alphanumeric characters, underscores, dots or forward
slashes.  Names containing any other characters should be quoted.

    [% INSERT misc/legalese.txt            %]
    [% INSERT 'dos98/Program Files/stupid' %]

To evaluate a variable to specify a filename, you should explicitly
prefix it with a '$' or use double-quoted string interpolation.

    [% language = 'en'
       legalese = 'misc/legalese.txt' 
    %]

    [% INSERT $legalese %]		# 'misc/legalese.txt'
    [% INSERT "$language/$legalese" %]  # 'en/misc/legalese.txt'

Multiple files can be specified using '+' as a delimiter.  All files
should be unquoted names or quoted strings.  Any variables should be
interpolated into double-quoted strings.

    [% INSERT legalese.txt + warning.txt %]
    [% INSERT  "$legalese" + warning.txt %]  # requires quoting
