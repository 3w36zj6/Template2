=item CLEAR

The CLEAR directive can be used to clear the output buffer for the current
enclosing block.   It is most commonly used to clear the output generated
from a TRY block up to the point where the error occurred.

    [% TRY %]
       blah blah blah            # this is normally left intact
       [% THROW some 'error' %]  # up to the point of error
       ...
    [% CATCH %]
       [% CLEAR %]               # clear the TRY output
       [% error %]               # print error string
    [% END %]
