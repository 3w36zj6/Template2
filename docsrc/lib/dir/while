=item WHILE

The WHILE directive can be used to repeatedly process a template block
while a conditional expression evaluates true.  The expression may 
be arbitrarily complex as per IF / UNLESS.

    [% WHILE total < 100 %]
       ...
       [% total = calculate_new_total %]
    [% END %]

An assignment can be enclosed in parenthesis to evaluate the assigned
value.

    [% WHILE (user = get_next_user_record) %]
       [% user.name %]
    [% END %]

The NEXT directive can be used to start the next iteration of a 
WHILE loop and BREAK can be used to exit the loop, both as per FOREACH.

The Template Toolkit uses a failsafe counter to prevent runaway WHILE
loops which would otherwise never terminate.  If the loop exceeds 1000
iterations then an 'undef' exception will be thrown, reporting the
error:

    WHILE loop terminated (> 1000 iterations)

The $Template::Directive::WHILE_MAX variable controls this behaviour
and can be set to a higher value if necessary.
