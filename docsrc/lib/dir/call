=item CALL

The CALL directive is similar to GET in evaluating the variable named,
but doesn't print the result returned.  This can be useful when a
variable is bound to a sub-routine or object method which you want to
call but aren't interested in the value returned.

    [% CALL dbi.disconnect %]

    [% CALL inc_page_counter(page_count) %]
