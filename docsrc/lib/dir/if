[% TAGS star %]
=item IF / UNLESS / ELSIF / ELSE

The IF and UNLESS directives can be used to process or ignore a
block based on some run-time condition.  

    [% IF frames %]
       [% INCLUDE frameset %]
    [% END %]

    [% UNLESS text_mode %]
       [% INCLUDE biglogo %]
    [% END %]

Multiple conditions may be joined with ELSIF and/or ELSE blocks.

    [% IF age < 10 %]
       Hello [% name %], does your mother know you're 
       using her AOL account?
    [% ELSIF age < 18 %]
       Sorry, you're not old enough to enter 
       (and too dumb to lie about your age)
    [% ELSE %]
       Welcome [% name %].
    [% END %]

The following conditional and boolean operators may be used:

    == != < <= > >= && || ! and or not

Note that C<and>, C<or> and C<not> are also provided as aliases for
C<&&>, C<||> and C<!>, respectively.

Conditions may be arbitrarily complex and are evaluated with the same
precedence as in Perl.  Parenthesis may be used to explicitly
determine evaluation order.

    # ridiculously contrived complex example
    [% IF (name == 'admin' || uid <= 0) && mode == 'debug' %]
       I'm confused.
    [% ELSIF more > less %]
       That's more or less correct.
    [% END %]
