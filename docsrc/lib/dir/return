[% TAGS star %]
=item RETURN

The RETURN directive can be used to stop processing the current
template and return to the template from which it was called, resuming
processing at the point immediately after the INCLUDE, PROCESS or
WRAPPER directive.  If there is no enclosing template then the
Template process() method will return to the calling code with a 
true value.
