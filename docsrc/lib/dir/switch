=item SWITCH / CASE

The SWITCH / CASE construct can be used to perform a multi-way
conditional test.  The SWITCH directive expects an expression which is
first evaluated and then compared against each CASE statement in turn.
Each CASE directive should contain a single value or a list of values
which should match.  CASE may also be left blank or written as [% CASE
DEFAULT %] to specify a default match.  Only one CASE matches, there
is no drop-through between CASE statements.

    [% SWITCH myvar %]
    [% CASE value1 %]
       ...
    [% CASE [ value2 value3 ] %]   # multiple values
       ...
    [% CASE myhash.keys %]         # ditto
       ...
    [% CASE %]                     # default
       ...
    [% END %]
