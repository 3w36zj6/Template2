[% TAGS star %]
=item COMMENTS

The '#' character is used to indicate comments within a directive.
When placed immediately inside the opening directive tag, it causes
the entire directive to be ignored.

    [%# this entire directive is ignored no
        matter how many lines it wraps onto
    %]

In any other position, it causes the remainder of the current line to 
be treated as a comment.

    [% # this is a one line comment
       a = 20
    %]
