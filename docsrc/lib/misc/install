The latest version of the Template Toolkit can be retrieved from:

    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Template/

Fetch and install AppConfig 1.56 if you don't already have it installed.
Available from CPAN in:

    http://www.cpan.org/authors/Andy_Wardley/

To install the Template Toolkit:

    tar zxf Template-Toolkit-[* tt.version *].tar.gz
    cd Template-Toolkit-[* tt.version *]
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install    

The Makefile.PL will prompt for additional configuration options,
including the installation of optional template libraries, HTML
documentation and examples.  You can safely answer 'n' to all of these
questions for a quick and basic installation.  

If you're running ActivePerl on a Win32 platform then you can use the
Perl Package Manager (PPM) to install the Template Toolkit.  Chris
Winters maintains a repository of pre-compiled PPM packages which contains
the Template Toolkit, AppConfig and others.  For further information, see:
