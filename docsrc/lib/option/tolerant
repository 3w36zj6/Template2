=item TOLERANT

The TOLERANT flag is used by the various Template Toolkit provider
modules (Template::Provider, Template::Plugins, Template::Filters) to
control their behaviour when errors are encountered.  By default, any
errors are reported as such, with the request for the particular
resource (template, plugin, filter) being denied and an exception
raised.  When the TOLERANT flag is set to any true values, errors will
be silently ignored and the provider will instead return
STATUS_DECLINED.  This allows a subsequent provider to take
responsibility for providing the resource, rather than failing the
request outright.  If all providers decline to service the request,
either through tolerated failure or a genuine disinclination to
comply, then a 'E<lt>resourceE<gt> not found' exception is raised.
