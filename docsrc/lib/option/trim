=item TRIM

The TRIM option can be set to have any leading and trailing whitespace 
automatically removed from the output of all template files and BLOCKs.

By example, the following BLOCK definition

    [% BLOCK foo %]
    Line 1 of foo
    [% END %]

will be processed is as "\nLine 1 of foo\n".  When INCLUDEd, the surrounding
newlines will also be introduced.

    before 
    [% INCLUDE foo %]
    after

output:
    before

    Line 1 of foo

    after

With the TRIM option set to any true value, the leading and trailing
newlines (which count as whitespace) will be removed from the output 
of the BLOCK.

    before
    Line 1 of foo
    after

The TRIM option is disabled (0) by default.
