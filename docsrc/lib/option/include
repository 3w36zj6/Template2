=item INCLUDE_PATH

The INCLUDE_PATH is used to specify one or more directories in which
template files are located.  When a template is requested that isn't
defined locally as a BLOCK, each of the INCLUDE_PATH directories is
searched in turn to locate the template file.  Multiple directories
can be specified as a reference to a list or as a single string where
each directory is delimited by ':'.

    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
        INCLUDE_PATH => '/usr/local/templates',
    });
  
    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
        INCLUDE_PATH => '/usr/local/templates:/tmp/my/templates',
    });
  
    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
        INCLUDE_PATH => [ '/usr/local/templates', 
                          '/tmp/my/templates' ],
    });

On Win32 systems, a little extra magic is invoked, ignoring delimiters
that have ':' followed by a '/' or '\'.  This avoids confusion when using
directory names like 'C:\Blah Blah'.
