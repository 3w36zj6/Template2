=item INCLUDE_PATH

The INCLUDE_PATH is used to specify one or more directories in which
template files are located.  When a template is requested that isn't
defined locally as a BLOCK, each of the INCLUDE_PATH directories is
searched in turn to locate the template file.  Multiple directories
can be specified as a reference to a list or as a single string where
each directory is delimited by ':'. The DELIMITER option can be set
to redefine the delimiter value.

    });
