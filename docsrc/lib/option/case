=item ANYCASE

By default, directive keywords should be expressed in UPPER CASE.  The 
ANYCASE option can be set to allow directive keywords to be specified
in any case.

    # ANYCASE => 0 (default)
    [% INCLUDE foobar %]	# OK
    [% include foobar %]        # ERROR
    [% include = 10   %]        # OK, 'include' is a variable

    # ANYCASE => 1
    [% INCLUDE foobar %]	# OK
    [% include foobar %]	# OK
    [% include = 10   %]        # ERROR, 'include' is reserved word

One side-effect of enabling ANYCASE is that you cannot use a variable
of the same name as a reserved word, regardless of case.  The reserved
words are currently:

    [* PROCESS misc/reserved *]

The only lower case reserved words that cannot be used for variables,
regardless of the ANYCASE option, are the operators:

    and or not mod div
