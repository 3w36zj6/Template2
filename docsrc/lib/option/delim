=item DELIMITER

Used to provide an alternative delimiter character sequence for 
separating paths specified in the INCLUDE_PATH.  The default
value for DELIMITER is ':'.

    # tolerate Silly Billy's file system conventions
    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
	DELIMITER    => '; ',
        INCLUDE_PATH => 'C:/HERE/NOW; D:/THERE/THEN',
    });

    # better solution: install Linux!  :-)

On Win32 systems, the default delimiter is a little more intelligent,
splitting paths only on ':' characters that aren't followed by a '/'.
This means that the following should work as planned, splitting the 
INCLUDE_PATH into 2 separate directories, C:/foo and C:/bar.

    # on Win32 only
    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
	INCLUDE_PATH => 'C:/Foo:C:/Bar'
    });

However, if you're using Win32 then it's recommended that you
explicitly set the DELIMITER character to something else (e.g. ';')
rather than rely on this subtle magic.
