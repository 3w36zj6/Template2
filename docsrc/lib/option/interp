=item INTERPOLATE

The INTERPOLATE flag, when set to any true value will cause variable 
references in plain text (i.e. not surrounded by START_TAG and END_TAG)
to be recognised and interpolated accordingly.  

    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({ 
  	INTERPOLATE => 1,
    });

Variables should be prefixed by a '$' to identify them.  Curly braces
can be used in the familiar Perl/shell style to explicitly scope the
variable name where required.

    # INTERPOLATE => 0
    <a href="http://[% server %]/[% help %]">
    <img src="[% images %]/help.gif"></a>
    [% myorg.name %]
  
    # INTERPOLATE => 1
    <a href="http://$server/$help">
    <img src="$images/help.gif"></a>
    $myorg.name
  
    # explicit scoping with {  }
    <img src="$images/${icon.next}.gif">

Note that a limitation in Perl's regex engine restricts the maximum length
of an interpolated template to around 32 kilobytes or possibly less.  Files
that exceed this limit in size will typically cause Perl to dump core with
a segmentation fault.  If you routinely process templates of this size 
then you should disable INTERPOLATE or split the templates in several 
smaller files or blocks which can then be joined backed together via 
PROCESS or INCLUDE.
