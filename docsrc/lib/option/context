=item CONTEXT

A reference to a Template::Context object which is used to define a 
specific environment in which template are processed.  A Template::Context
object is passed as the only parameter to the Perl subroutines that 
represent "compiled" template documents.  Template subroutines make 
callbacks into the context object to access Template Toolkit functionality,
for example, to to INCLUDE or PROCESS another template (include() and 
process() methods, respectively), to USE a plugin (plugin()) or 
instantiate a filter (filter()) or to access the stash (stash()) which 
manages variable definitions via the get() and set() methods.
