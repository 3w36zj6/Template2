=item PRE_CHOMP, POST_CHOMP

Anything outside a directive tag is considered plain text and is
generally passed through unaltered (but see the INTERPOLATE option).
This includes all whitespace and newlines characters surrounding
directive tags.  Directives that don't generate any output will leave
gaps in the output document.

Example:

    Foo
    [% a = 10 %]
    Bar

Output:

    Foo

    Bar

The PRE_CHOMP and POST_CHOMP options can help to clean up some of this
extraneous whitespace.  Both are disabled by default.

    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
	PRE_CHOMP  => 1,
	POST_CHOMP => 1,
    });

With PRE_CHOMP set to 1, the newline and whitespace preceding a directive
at the start of a line will be deleted.  This has the effect of 
concatenating a line that starts with a directive onto the end of the 
previous line.

 	Foo <----------.
 		       |
    ,---(PRE_CHOMP)----'
    |
    `-- [% a = 10 %] --.
 		       |
    ,---(POST_CHOMP)---'
    |
    `-> Bar

With POST_CHOMP set to 1, any whitespace after a directive up to and
including the newline will be deleted.  This has the effect of joining
a line that ends with a directive onto the start of the next line.

If PRE_CHOMP or POST_CHOMP is set to 2, then instead of removing all
the whitespace, the whitespace will be collapsed to a single space.
This is useful for HTML, where (usually) a contiguous block of
whitespace is rendered the same as a single space.

You may use the CHOMP_NONE, CHOMP_ALL, and CHOMP_COLLAPSE constants
from the Template::Constants module to deactivate chomping, remove
all whitespace, or collapse whitespace to a single space.

PRE_CHOMP and POST_CHOMP can be activated for individual directives by
placing a '-' immediately at the start and/or end of the directive.

    [% FOREACH user = userlist %]
       [%- user -%]
    [% END %]

The '-' characters activate both PRE_CHOMP and POST_CHOMP for the one
directive '[%- name -%]'.  Thus, the template will be processed as if
written:

    [% FOREACH user = userlist %][% user %][% END %]

Note that this is the same as if PRE_CHOMP and POST_CHOMP were set
to CHOMP_ALL; the only way to get the CHOMP_COLLAPSE behavior is
to set PRE_CHOMP or POST_CHOMP accordingly.  If PRE_CHOMP or POST_CHOMP
is already set to CHOMP_COLLAPSE, using '-' will give you CHOMP_COLLAPSE
behavior, not CHOMP_ALL behavior.

Similarly, '+' characters can be used to disable PRE_CHOMP or
POST_CHOMP (i.e.  leave the whitespace/newline intact) options on a
per-directive basis.

    [% FOREACH user = userlist %]
    User: [% user +%]
    [% END %]

With POST_CHOMP enabled, the above example would be parsed as if written:

    [% FOREACH user = userlist %]User: [% user %]
    [% END %]
