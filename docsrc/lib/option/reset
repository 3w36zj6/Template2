=item AUTO_RESET

The AUTO_RESET option is set by default and causes the local BLOCKS
cache for the Template::Context object to be reset on each call to the
Template process() method.  This ensures that any BLOCKs defined
within a template will only persist until that template is finished
processing.  This prevents BLOCKs defined in one processing request
from interfering with other independent requests subsequently
processed by the same context object.

The BLOCKS item may be used to specify a default set of block definitions
for the Template::Context object.  Subsequent BLOCK definitions in templates
will over-ride these but they will be reinstated on each reset if AUTO_RESET
is enabled (default), or if the Template::Context reset() method is called.
