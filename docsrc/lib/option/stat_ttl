=item STAT_TTL

This value can be set to control how long the Template::Provider will keep a
template cached in memory before checking to see if the source template has
changed. 

    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
        STAT_TTL => 60,  # one minute
    });

The default value is 1 (second). You'll probably want to set this to a higher
value if you're running the Template Toolkit inside a persistent web server
application (e.g. mod_perl). For example, set it to 60 and the provider will
only look for changes to templates once a minute at most. However, during
development (or any time you're making frequent changes to templates) you'll
probably want to keep it set to a low value so that you don't have to wait
for the provider to notice that your templates have changed.
