=item LOAD_FILTERS

The LOAD_FILTERS option can be used to specify a list of provider
objects (i.e. they implement the fetch() method) which are responsible
for returning and/or creating filter subroutines.  The
Template::Context filter() method queries each provider in turn in a
"Chain of Responsibility" as per the template() and plugin() methods.

    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
	LOAD_FILTERS => [
    	    MyTemplate::Filters->new(),
    	    Template::Filters->new(),
	],
    });

By default, a single Template::Filters object is created for the
LOAD_FILTERS list.
