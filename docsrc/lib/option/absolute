=item ABSOLUTE

The ABSOLUTE flag is used to indicate if templates specified with
absolute filenames (e.g. '/foo/bar') should be processed.  It is
disabled by default and any attempt to load a template by such a
name will cause a 'file' exception to be raised.

    my [* obj *] = [* pkg *]->new({
	ABSOLUTE => 1,
    });

    # this is why it's disabled by default
    [% INSERT /etc/passwd %]

On Win32 systems, the regular expression for matching absolute 
pathnames is tweaked slightly to also detect filenames that start
with a driver letter and colon, such as:

    C:/Foo/Bar
